1- Find the number of cases per year 
2-Find the number of death per year  
3- Replace the missing values by zero.

Data Preprocessing (I made the separation of the columns ''No. of cases'' and ''No. of deaths'' with Excel's power query. Then, I imported the file on Jutyper Notebook. I made a copy, checked the type of our file, displayed all the data, checked all the information about our file, checked the missing values and also checked the columns that are concerned by your work).

Data cleaning (I renamed the columns, replaced the columns and replaced the missing values)

Data Manipulation (I applied a dummy on the columns Year in order to make my work clearer. 

Data Analysis (Using mathematics and statistics functions, interpretations, ...) â€“ 

Data visualization (I used a bar chart to display my results).
